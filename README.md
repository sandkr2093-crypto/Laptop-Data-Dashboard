# LAPTOP  DATA  PRICE  ANALYSIS (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze laptop and desktop device data to uncover pricing trends, performance patterns, and hardware value distribution across brands, storage types, and specifications.

This dashboard aims to:

Provide data-driven insights on how factors like RAM, CPU brand, GPU tier, and storage type influence device prices.

Help identify premium brands and models based on pricing and performance indicators.

Enable users to compare devices efficiently by filtering across various attributes such as brand, device type, release year, and operating system.

Support decision-making for buyers, sellers, and analysts by visualizing the relationships between technical specifications and market value.

## Visual Insights:
Average Price by Brand â€“ Compare pricing trends among top brands.

Average CPU Tier by Brand â€“ Shows brand performance hierarchy.

GPU Tier vs Price â€“ Correlation between GPU capability and device price.

RAM vs Price by Device Type â€“ Analyze how RAM size affects price across devices.

Total Device Value by Storage Type (Pie Chart) â€“ Breakdown by SSD, NVMe, HDD, Hybrid.

Top 5 Most Expensive Devices â€“ Highlights premium models with maximum price tags.
## Key Insights:
Apple leads in both CPU tier and average price, reflecting its premium positioning.

NVMe storage contributes the most to total value (â‰ˆ45%), indicating user preference for faster drives.

Higher RAM (â‰¥128GB) devices are mostly Desktops, priced significantly higher.

Samsung models dominate the Top 5 Most Expensive Devices, showing its strong presence in the premium segment.

Despite similar average prices across brands (â‰ˆ1.8Kâ€“2.4K), Appleâ€™s performance metrics outperform others.
